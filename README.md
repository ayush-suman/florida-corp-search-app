# Scrapper App

This is a simple frontend to connect with the crawler and the search services of Florida Corp Search backend.

# How to run

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

Simple?

### Known Limitations
setSearchResult is not rerendering the screen due to which the search result from backend is not loaded in the UI. As a POC and workaround, you can see the incoming responses in the console.
